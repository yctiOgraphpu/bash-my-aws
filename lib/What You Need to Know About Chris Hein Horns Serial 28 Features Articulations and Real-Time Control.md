This instrument can create realistic and expressive saxophone arrangements for any genre, from smooth jazz to funky grooves. The instrument has a rich and warm sound, with a wide range of dynamics and expressions. The instrument also has a flexible interface that allows the user to adjust the volume, pan, tuning, attack, release and legato of each saxophone individually or as a group.
