Resident Evil 6 is not the only game that has encountered errors related to nativePC arc DX9 files. Some other games that have reported similar issues are Resident Evil 5, Devil May Cry 4, and Lost Planet 2. These games use the same engine as Resident Evil 6, which is called MT Framework. This engine allows the developers to create games for multiple platforms, such as PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as compatibility problems and performance issues.
 
One of the reasons why these errors occur is because of the different versions of DirectX that are used by the games and the PC. DirectX is a collection of software components that enable games and other multimedia applications to run on Windows. There are different versions of DirectX, such as DirectX 9, DirectX 10, and DirectX 11. Each version has different features and requirements. For example, DirectX 9 is compatible with Windows XP and later versions, while DirectX 11 is compatible with Windows Vista and later versions.
 
Some games use different versions of DirectX depending on the platform they are running on. For example, Resident Evil 6 uses DirectX 9 for PC and Xbox 360, and DirectX 10 for PlayStation 3. This means that the game files are different for each platform. The nativePC arc DX9 files are specific to the PC version of the game, which uses DirectX 9. However, if the PC has a newer version of DirectX installed, such as DirectX 10 or DirectX 11, it may cause conflicts and errors with the game files.
 
Therefore, one of the possible solutions to fix these errors is to update or downgrade your DirectX version to match the game's requirements. To do this, follow these steps:
